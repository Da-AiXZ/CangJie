# CangJie Project Control Center

- Authority: current operational truth
- Updated: 2026-07-16
- Repository: `F:\project\CangJie`
- Remote: `https://github.com/Da-AiXZ/CangJie`, branch `main`

## Product and UI decision

CangJie is agent-first: persistent center conversation controls a governed novel engine through typed tools. The left region has an independent `NavigationStack`; Novel Projects pushes a dedicated page with back navigation, never an in-place tree and never a center reset. The right artifact/approval drawer is collapsed by default. Workbenches are secondary.

## Authority order

`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` -> this file -> `COMPOUNDING_AND_PITFALLS.md` -> ADRs -> `M0_VALIDATION.md`. `ROADMAP.md` is retired.

## Current milestone

M1 First-Chapter Agent Vertical Slice; current slice M1-A Agent-first shell and real project tools; implementation is in progress.

```text
open -> center conversation -> ask to create cultivation novel
-> project.create -> durable record -> left Projects page shows it
-> center remains intact -> Agent reports verified receipt
```

User confirmed TrollStore install, launch, immediate restart persistence, and no immediate crash. Not yet proven: M1 UI/tools, complete Keychain tests, real Provider SSE/cancel/reconcile, interview/bible/generation/canon/import/serial flow.

## Source boundaries

Novel package concepts are recorded in the plan. `cc.zip` is clean-room abstract reference only. Private audit evidence stays outside Git at `F:\NVA-AUDIT-0716\` and the workspace `_cc_cleanroom_audit` directory.

## Immediate queue

1. Commit/push this documentation baseline and inspect Actions.
2. Start M1-A with failing core/UI tests.
3. Build stable shell ownership and independent left navigation.
4. Add minimum conversation/project/run/event/artifact schema.
5. Implement real project create/list/inspect and run inspect tools.
6. Complete Fake Provider E2E and candidate IPA.
7. Update this file and pitfalls log after every slice.

## Change log

### 2026-07-16 Agent-first reset

Retired old roadmap; corrected left navigation; established runtime/tool/canon/clean-room baseline. The first write was corrupted into question marks and repeated blocks, so the documents were rewritten in ASCII-dominant UTF-8 and an encoding gate was added. Documentation baseline commit: `bdf0056`. Post-push Actions are checked separately after this entry.

## 2026-07-16 M1-A implementation checkpoint

Implemented the first real vertical slice in `App/CangJieApp/ContentView.swift`, `AppViewModel.swift`, and `AppDatabase.swift`: persistent center conversation shell, independent left navigation to Novel Projects, collapsed artifact drawer, `novelProject` migration, and project create/list persistence. Added AppDatabase/AppViewModel tests. Windows `swift test` passed all 35 core tests. iOS App compilation and UI tests remain pending GitHub Actions.

## Continuous execution rule

Progress summaries are informational checkpoints, not pauses. After reporting completed work and the next action, continue automatically. Stop only when a major milestone has produced a candidate IPA requiring physical-device installation/acceptance, or when required user input is genuinely unavailable. At a device gate, provide artifact source, hash, install steps, test script, expected results, and rollback notes.


## 2026-07-16 M1-B implementation checkpoint

Added durable `AgentArtifact` storage for the opening plan, deterministic strategic interview state, restart restoration, an approval gate, and the first plan card in the artifact area. Added database and view-model tests. The previous iPadOS failure was diagnosed from the first compiler error (`makeDatabase` missing in `AppDatabaseTests`) and fixed before this slice.
